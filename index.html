    My name is Raychel, I am class of 2022 and I stay in Connecticut. I Believe my mom told me about the class and it seemed interesting so here I am trying it. I donâ€™t really have a specific interest in technology because everything about technology is interesting like coding and how it works, how everything is made using technology etc. I enjoy drawing and playing video games, I work part time at a Wal-Mart. I have an interest in shoes and clothing too.
